The transition from fibrin, formed between the two surfaces of the wound as the first stage of healing, through the phase of diminishing reaction, to the quiescent relatively avascular scar takes place slowly over a period of months."

Examples of factors beyond the surgeon's control are the age of the patient, the site and often the direc- tion of the wound or incision. Scars in children generally remain harder and redder for longer than in the adult, and the end result is poorer, this quite apart from the greater tendency of scars in children than in adults to develop hypertrophic change or even keloid. One of the compensations of age is the fact that the more wrinkled the skin the more rapidly a scar settles and the better is its final appearance, hidden amongst the wrinkles."

Outside the face and neck, scars are apt to stay conspicuous despite careful surgical technique, and stretching even of the most meticulously handled incision is frequent. In the face too, different sites and different skins vary greatly in the way they behave. Coarse, oily skin tends to produce more than the usual reaction to sutures and suture marks are more common as a result. The problem arises most strikingly in the nose where the skin can be very thick, with active sebaceous glands, most markedly towards the tip. In hairless skin sites, such as the red margin of the lips and the palms and soles, scars are usually less conspicuous. Probably the best example of the influence of site is the upper ster- nal area where scars almost always become keloid."

It recognises that an optimum result cannot be expected from the healing of such a wound, and accepts at the out- set the probable need for subsequent revisional surgery.

The taking of a slightly greater bite by the needle of its deeper part, dermis or fat, has the effect of approximating the entire face of the wound edge and creates a degree of eversion. The wound edges are also sometimes undermined for 2-4 mm and held everted as the needle is inserted, allowing its path to take the desirable greater deep bite. As already indicated a skin hook can be used to hold the wound edge everted (Fig. 1.11), though dissecting forceps are more usual. The side of the thumb can also be used effectively to evert the skin during the insertion of the needle (Fig. 1.12).

The blanket stitch has the advantage of not 'bunching up' the wound and a double turn at each stitch converts it into a locked suture. The 'over-and-over' suture unfortunately does tend to bunch the wound. Such sutures cannot be placed as accurately as the interrupted suture, but where an impeccable scar is not essential they certainly save time. It is sometimes stated that the continuous suture tends to strangulate the wound edge, but this is the result of unduly tight insertion rather than any inherent defect of the method."

Using silk, the appropriate degree of eversion of the wound, tension in tying the suture, and the placing of the knot to ensure that the wound edges are accurately apposed, are all easier to achieve than with the synthetics.

The reaction to buried catgut is generally considered to be greater than with the newer synthetic mater- ials, such as Vicryl, Dexon and PDS. This gener- alisation needs to be analysed in a little more depth, since the amount of the reaction also depends on the volume of the buried material. Even the slower absorption of the newer materials is accompanied by the presence of a granuloma at the site of each buried suture, even on occasion an abscess, and these persist as long as the material remains. The minimal reaction when 6-0 catgut is used in closing the skin in the primary repair of a cleft lip in a baby clearly reflects the small amount of catgut in the tissues, and it appears to be more than offset by the absence of the trauma involved in suture removal. Clearly a good deal depends on the cir- cumstances in which the sutures are used."

Here again, the evid- ence for this is derived from clinical impression."

At this stage there is no tendency to fresh bleeding and recurrence of the condition. The problem is that liquefaction can take up to 10 days, and in the interval it may become infected. Once infection develops, evacuation by opening the suture line, or even incision and drainage, may be needed although spontaneous discharge may occur. With a low-grade infection, aspira- tion may suffice if the clot cum pus has become sufficiently fluid."

Applied directly over the wound, its adhe- siveness encourages the wound edges to lie flush, a useful attribute when flap tips are tend- ing to lie a little proud of the wound as a whole. If no undermining has been used, such tape can provide the sole dressing. Apart from its role in the sutured wound, it can also on occasion be used to coapt wound edges and obviate the need for sutures at all, a considerable virtue when the young child with a laceration is being treated. When applying Elastoplast or adhesive paper strips, the surgeon should avoid placing the dressing with the skin under undue tension, either by stretching the Elastoplast or by putting the paper strip on one side of the wound and then pulling the skin closer to the other side of the wound. This creates a reaction in the under- lying skin which is similar in appearance to dermatitis. Patients who have experienced this problem frequently, but erroneously, describe themselves as having an allergy to the dressing materials."

A mild degree of reaction at the site of the sutures is not uncommon, settling when they are removed and seeming not to affect the final result adversely. The severity of the reaction seems to parallel the degree of sebaceous activity in the particular area of the face and in the indi- vidual patient. The use of chloramphenicol oint- ment, conveniently applied from the small tube designed for ophthalmic use, has been found to eliminate this reaction to a considerable extent, and it has the incidental virtue of softening any minor discharge around the individual sutures and facilitating their removal. Rarely, chloram- phenicol sensitises to sunlight, under which cir- cumstances other ointments such as mupirocin or Polyfax (polymyxin and bacitracin) can be used as alternatives."

In contracting, the burn scar contracts in all directions simultan- eously, and although a contracture may be pres- ent clinically, skin has actually been lost in every axis.

In this, the Zs, instead of being individual, are designed as a continuous series with a single line along the length of the contracture and multiple Z side limbs (Fig. 11.7). In theory such a multiple Z-plasty can be constructed with the side limbs parallel or skew. The presence of scarring in a particular line may influence the construction and make skew flaps preferable, but the use of parallel limbs allows the flaps to transpose uniformly. It also avoids the construction of a broad-tipped flap with a narrow base, undesirable from a vascular point of view, and unavoidable with the skew construction."

The effect is to convert the single linear scar into a series of smaller scars joined by transverse limbs in lines of election, ideally in actual wrinkle lines. Even at worst, several small scars tend to be less con- spicuous than a single long scar. It is also found that a large Z-plasty does not give as good a In planning result as the smaller Z-plasty. therefore, the estimated length of the transverse limb should be kept fairly small (Fig. 2.13)."

Revision, with or without a Z- plasty, is generally postponed until the scar has largely settled, and the improvement in its appearance is near maximal. Revision, incorpor- ating one or more Z-plasties, involves increasing the length of the wound significantly, and the early result all too often appears disappointing both to surgeon and patient. Only once the reaction has slowly settled, and the scars soften once again, does the benefit become apparent."

The anatomical basis of the vascular network varies considerably in dif- ferent sites of the body, and flaps with a striking diversity of tissue content and vascular patterns have been developed to exploit these variations. flap types are largely named according to the tissue transferred. A flap which consists of skin and superficial fascia is referred to as a skin flap. When the investing layer of deep fascia is included, the flap becomes fascio- cutaneous. A flap may also consist of a muscle, usually detached at one end, and moved to cover a surface which is unsuitable for grafting, for example bare cortical bone. When covered by such a muscle flap, the surface which results accepts a graft readily. The principle of the mus- cle flap has been extended to include the skin overlying the muscle, on occasion also bone to which the muscle is attached, the composite flap being myocutaneous or osteomyocutaneous depending on the constituents."

Alternatively, the transfer may involve the movement of tissue at a distance from the primary defect, and is then called a distant flap. The entire flap, or its greater part, may be inset into the defect at the initial transfer, and the proximal segment is then referred to as its base. Alternatively, only the distal segment of the flap may be inset into the defect, its central segment and base remaining unattached. The base is then often referred to as the pedicle of the flap and the central segment as its bridge segment. These two, pedicle and bridge segment, act as the car- rier of the flap and provide the channel of blood supply to its distal segment. It is generally con- sidered desirable to eliminate unnecessary raw surface in such a flap, and so reduce the likeli- hood of infection, and this explains the practice of either tubing the bridge segment of a flap, or lining it with a split skin graft depending on the local circumstances. It is seldom techni- cally possible to tube or line the local flaps commonly used in the face, but infection is rarely a problem because of the excellence of the local blood supply."

To refer to sucha transfer as a graft, admittedly a vascularised graft, may be regarded by the purist as a misnomer, but it has become standard usage, and as suchhas probably to be accepted."

Embarrassment of the circulation shows in the appearance of the muscle fibres, with slight darkening in colour where the blood supply is inadequate. The need to avoid tension and compression means that tunnelling of the muscle through deep fascia or under skin to reach its destination has to be used with extreme discretion. In the lower limb, the deep fascia is strong and unyielding, and is more likely to be the source of tension or compression than the skin. There should be no hesitation in dividing the fascia widely, and even excising areas if necessary, in order to provide the muscle belly with a free passage to its destination. Allowance also needs to be made in planning for a degree of swelling of the muscle belly in the early phase after transfer. Muscle does not toler- ate sutures which exert significant tension or crush the fibres, and any sutures should only be of a tacking nature, used to hold the muscle over the defect without exerting traction. Associated aponeurosis or tendon should be used wherever possible for holding sutures, and it is for this reason that wherever possible a fringe of tendon is taken with the muscle when it is detached in preparation for transfer."

In the case of a random pattern flap, it concerns such factors as its length:breadth ratio and making allowance for the normal increase in tension with the temporary phase of oedema generally seen in such a flap. In the axial pattern flap, design is particularly concerned with ensur- ing that the flap includes its axial arteriovenous system and does not extend beyond its recog- nised safe length. These factors all vary in the different flaps and will be discussed in relation to each."

The face has no comparable natural plane and one has to be artificially created when raising the flap. The level chosen is the fat just deep to the dermis. This leaves the flap with the rich subdermal circulation present in facial skin, while not disturbing the facial nerve or muscles. In the scalp, the plane lies between the galea aponeurotica and the pericranium, virtually no vessels crossing the interface.

The presence of the breast in the female compli- cates matters when the flap encroaches on it, particularly where the breast is large and pen- dulous. There should be no hesitation about thinning the flap to make its overall thickness correspond to that of the part of the flap outwith the margin of the breast. The problem of thinning is less easily solved when the flap is being raised from the lower abdomen or groin. This is a notoriously fat site in many adults, and indeed the presence of fat in excess may be a valid reason for selecting an alternative site when a flap is being planned.

The inequality in length between the two borders of the flap which this slack creates means that any tension line developed during transfer tends to be along the shorter upper bor- der and not the longer lower border.

None- theless, in raising axial flaps, the fascial layer is generally included, taking advantage of the additional vascular efficiency which it provides. In both the lower leg and forearm, the vascular pattern is basically similar, with individual per- forating vessels passing outwards from the main vascular trunks in the septa between the muscle groups to supply the plexus of the investing fascial layer. This results in lines of perforators along the axis of the limb (Figs 4.9 and 4.11)."

As a result careful geometrical planning is essential. The limb also tapers towards the ankle, and in its distal third the subcutaneous border of the tibia takes on an increasing proportion of the limb circumference. This has the effect of reducing the size of the defect which can be covered from either side, and it becomes increasingly difficult to design a flap of suitable size which can be transposed into the defect."

This, however, is not the com- monly used form of transfer. The presence of two arteriovenous systems, one of which, judging from the experience of dialysis, can be sacrificed with impunity, and the shortness of the perfora- tor vessels, have made it feasible to raise skin and fascia together with the radial vessels and the intervening system of perforators as a single package, perfused effectively from the radial artery. Such a flap can be transferred as an island on a pedicle confined to either the distal or prox- imal radial vessels depending on the geometry of the transfer. Elevation of the flap is similar in essence to that used in raising it as a free flap, and is described on p. 112 et seq. A comparable flap based on the ulnar vessels is also possible but it would appear to offer no special advantages."

Alternatively the donor vessel in the recipient site may be divided and anastomosis carried out end-to-end. The pres- ence of collateral circulation in most body sites allows diversion of an artery to act as the donor vessel for a free flap without compromising tis- sue viability in its vicinity, and end-to-end anas- tomosis safe. Following trauma, however, vessels can become virtual end- arteries, and division is then liable to result in ischaemia of the region they normally sup- ply. End-to-side anastomosis, which preserves the pre-existing flow pattern of the artery, then becomes essential."

When vessel diameters are similar it is usual, although not obligatory, to use end-to-end anastomosis. If the diameters are nearly equal, gentle dilatation of the narrower lumen will still allow end-to-end anastomosis to be carried out. When inequality is greater, be technically possible, but turbulent blood flow with thrombosis is then likely, and end-to-side anastomosis should be used."

Care is required to select a vessel of suitable calibre to provide a reasonable match for the vessels to which the graft is to be anastomosed. Harvest of the vein graft should be atraumatic, with careful bipolar coagulation or ligation of side branches. The length and axial orientation need to be accurate when it is inserted into importantly the direction the defect. Most must be adjusted to take account of the valves in the vein graft. Consequently, the graft must be reversed before insertion into the arterial side of the circulation, and be orientated nor- mally for bridging the venous deficit. Con- siderable dilatation of vein grafts bridging arterial defects is the norm. This creates a tendency to turbulent flow and, because there are four rather than two anastomoses, the vascular com- plication rate due to thrombosis tends to be high- er than usual. The technique of microvascular suture is unaltered and each anastomosis can be end-to-end or end-to-side as local circumstances dictate."

The posterior branch, with an external diameter of 1.5-2 mm, is consistently present, with associated venae comitantes, running distally in the intermuscular septum between triceps and the brachialis-brachioradialis muscle group. In the intermuscular septum it gives off branches which reach the investing layer of deep fascia and the overlying skin. Additional multiple small vessels pass from it into the surrounding muscles, and also reach the humeral periosteum to which the intermuscular septum is attached."

The shortness of the pedi- cle and the small calibre of the vessels involved, unless extended to the origin of the circumflex scapular vessels, make for a degree of technical difficulty in the transfer, and the extension adds considerably to the difficulty of dissection. A fur- ther adverse factor is that both flaps involve turning the patient, unless the surgeon is willing to carry out the entire procedure, creation of the defect and elevation of the flap, in the lateral position, a position which for most surgeons lacks the virtue of familiarity.

The cannula is blunt ended, and in its to and fro movements it disrupts the fat, which is sucked out into the suction pump reservoir, the blood vessels traversing the area largely escaping damage. It is important the suction should not be applied, either superficially as far as the deep surface of the dermis which results in a lumpy skin surface, or deeply as far as the deep fascial layer which creates an area of adhesion of the skin. With suction completed, a pressure dressing is applied to the site. Local bruising can be considerable, but infective complications are infrequent."

Radiotherapy was also at one time a standard method of treating such facial conditions as acne, sycosis barbae, or lupus vulgaris, and ringworm of the scalp. Although it may no longer be used in this way, patients are still seen with the problems which have resulted from its use. The type of radiation used did not penetrate deeply, and it is unusual to find the deeper tissues significantly involved. As a result, the excision required in treating an area of radiodermatitis does not often need to be carried deeply much beyond the skin and der- mis. When there is doubt about how deeply the condition extends, the degree of mobility of the skin is a good guide, mobility indicating absence of deep involvement. The vascularity of the base left when the area of radiodermatitis has been excised will also give a good guide to the form that reconstruction should take, graft or flap. A free skin graft can generally be expected to take well, provided excision has been carried out to clinically tissue, though the defect following excision of radiodermatitis of the scalp treated 40-50 years ago for ringworm is not usually successfully managed using a split skin graft."

The tissues involved are woody hard, and when essential structures such as major vessels and nerves lie in the involved field the technical diffi- culties do not require stressing. Ideally the entire area of involvement should be excised both mar- ginally and in depth as a preliminary to recon- struction, but this may not always be practicable, particularly in terms of depth clearance, because structures. of Reconstruction of such a defect virtually always requires a flap with the blood supply which it brings with it. If it has not been possible to resect the radionecrotic area in its entirety, the pedicle of the flap used to reconstruct the defect, with its content of blood vessels, is best left undivided indefinitely. Division of the pedicle in such cir- cumstances, even after a very prolonged period of time, is liable to be followed by necrosis of the flap, but if the zone of avascularity has been completely resected the problem does not arise. If a free flap has been used it is essential to use donor vessels outwith the area of radiation damage."

Although immobility is ultimately responsible for the local pressure being prolonged for sufficiently long to produce the local ischaemia which leads to the sores, other factors are usually present which predispose to their occurrence. Sores occur most often as a complication of an emaciating illness. Loss of subcutaneous fat reduces the cushion it provides and, coupled with the reluctance of the patient to move as a consequence of the lassitude typical of such an illness, combines to create the conditions for their occurrence. When a pressure sore arises in a relatively young patient, a neurological factor, such as multiple sclerosis, is virtually always present."

The length of the flap is determined by the geometry of the transfer but it can safely extend to the junc- tion between the upper two-thirds and the lower third of the thigh. The flap is technically easy to raise because the plane between the tract and vastus lateralis is so well defined and avascular. It can be raised proximally to the level of the pubic tubercle. Its usual use is as a transposed flap, moved posteriorly to cover a defect of"

It would be wrong to deprive a patient of the chance to save his lower limb entire but it should also be recognised that on occasion conservation can be carried too far.

The cover provided by the extensive muscle attachments to the other long bones distances them from the surface, and eliminates to a large extent the problem of providing effective skin cover after surgery.

In order to function properly in the case of a tendon, or for axon regeneration in the case of a nerve, a covering of subcutaneous tissue as well as the skin is necessary, and this carries implication that cover by a flap will be required. When the skin defect is being reconstructed primarily using a flap, the possibility of carrying the tendon and/or nerve reconstruction out simultaneously theoretically exists, but the decision may well depend on the degree of experience of involved. The the surgeonis) considerations which would determine such a decision concern the degree of tissue damage and wound contamination present, and whether an adequate primary debridement is possible, whether failure to reconstruct primarily is likely to result in much poorer final function, and whether the posture which may be required of the tendon/nerve reconstruction will preclude the use of the method of providing skin cover considered otherwise appropriate. The cautious approach is to provide primary flap cover and carry out the tendon/nerve reconstruction as a secondary procedure."

The flap is rotated to fill the lower lip defect and sutured in position. The effect is to leave the angle at its original site and maintain the width of the mouth. The secondary defect in the nasolabial area is closed directly, taking up the slack which is availability. The present reconstructed lip segment lacks a vermilion, and this is best provided by incorporating a tongue flap.

The degree of mobility of the tumour on the orbicularis muscle and tarsal plate is an excellent indicator of whether a partial thickness resection of the lid will be adequate, or whether a full thickness resection is needed. The majority of the tumours seen in clinical practice are superficial, and only require resection of skin and part thickness of orbicularis muscle, though the closer the lesion to the lid margin the more likely it is to be found that a full thickness resection is required. The presence of distortion of the lid is virtually diagnostic of the need for a full thickness excision."

The method of suture used to close the defect is designed to avoid suture material being exposed in the conjunctival sac, since it causes irritation of the cornea where the two come into contact. The tarsal plate is closely adherent to the conjunctiva, and the two behave as a single structure, making it possible, by matching the tarsal plates, to approximate the margins of the associated conjunctiva, which then heals very rapidly. The defect can be closed in two layers, a tarso-conjunctival and a skin-muscle. Using 6-0 catgut on an atraumatic needle, the margins of the tarsal plate are approximated using inter- rupted sutures with the knot placed on the skin side. The skin and orbicularis muscle are then closed as a single layer. To use 6-0 catgut successfully in this way, tension across the tarsal plate suture line must be minimal, and this limits the width of the V which can be closed directly to a little less than one-quarter of the eyelid width. When it is apparent that tension across the suture line is likely to be unacceptable, it can be reduced by dividing the limb of the lateral canthal ligament to the eyelid, approaching it through the conjunctiva at the lateral canthus, V- excision and lateral canthotomy (Fig. 10.17)."

The flap is outlined by continuing the upward curve of the eyelid margin on to the temple almost as far as the hairline, with a downward back-cut, equal in length and parallel to, the lateral limb of the V. The flap is elevated, dividing the lower limb of the canthal ligament, and the flap is transposed medially. It may be necessary in addition to divide the orbital septum and any other lid attachments deep to the skin which are felt to be limiting movement of the flap medially. There is ample slack in the conjunctiva present in the lateral fornix to be taken up as the flap is drawn medially, and provide lining for the part of the flap which is forming the reconstructed eyelid segment. The two limbs of the V are approx- imated and sutured together, and the free edge of the reconstructed eyelid segment is sutured to the conjunctiva which it has drawn medially with it. The effect of transposing the skin flap medially in this way is to leave a triangular secondary defect laterally, corresponding to the wedge initially resected from the eyelid. This is closed by rotating a small flap, outlined at the planning stage of the procedure, at the lateral extremity of the transposed flap, and giving the appearance locally of a Z. Rotation of the flap downwards to fill the lateral triangular defect completes the reconstruction."

This has made such an extreme attitude untenable, and the approach of the surgeon should be the commonsense one of assessing how vital a full-length thumb is likely to be, given the patient's work requirements, and also how long he can afford to be off work. Suffice it to say that there should be no excessive trimming of a traumatically amputated thumb to get skin cover, and free skin grafting may be legitimate as a temporary measure pending more definitive management. It is also true as a generalisation that the greater the number of digits injured the greater the need to conserve the length of individual fingers."

If it is not viable, treatment is as for a guillotine amputation, but with a viable flap the fingertip should be reconstituted after minimal excision of wound edges and pulp fat. The nail should be retained and replaced in its bed to provide splintage and help to ensure a smooth nail-bed after healing.

The common cause of graft failure in this situation is haematoma and in fact haemostasis in a fingertip injury is not always easy to achieve. There is much to be said for delayed grafting, postponing application for 24 hours to allow for natural haemostasis. It is not even essential to suture the graft in position with a tie-over dressing. Micropore tape can be used most effectively to hold the graft in position. Indeed, tape has a most useful role in minor hand injuries generally, particularly in children where it can sometimes obviate the need for an anaesthetic of any kind. The suitability of a fingertip defect for grafting can be judged by comparing the area of bare exposed bone with the area of soft tissue: the greater the soft tissue the more suitable for grafting, the greater the area of bone the less suitable for grafting."

Even when the skin is soft and without any suggestion of callosity, an illusion of rigidity is created by its limited amount of mobility. The limitation is largely due to the pattern of flexure line 'creases' on the palm and the digits. Along these lines the skin is fixed deeply, to the palmar fascia in the palm, and to the fibrous flexor sheaths in the digits, the cushion of fibro-fatty pads which separate them elsewhere being absent. The effect of this deep fixation of the skin along the flexion creases is to limit areas between, particularly where the distance between two creases is short, as between the proximal and distal palmar creases. It also largely restricts the width of the defect which can be closed directly"

It is not always possible to avoid such contraction but its more severe effects can at least be mitigated by placing the margins of the graft along one of the elective incision lines already described (p. 191). The bringing of the graft margin to such a line may of course mean carrying the graft beyond the obvious defect, if need be excising normal skin to do so.

The deltopectoral flap (Fig. 11.12) is also capable of providing a considerable area of thin flexible It maintains the hand in an elevated skin. position, and on that basis might be expected to counter the development of oedema. In practice, the ease with which the hand can be brought to the chest and maintained there depends on the physical characteristics of the patient, easy when the patient is thin, difficult in the case of the short, broad-chested individual. This is an aspect easily tested, and would be part of the selection process. The role of the deltopectoral flap has historically been in head and neck surgery, but for the hand surgeon restricted to the use of pedicled flaps it is worthy of consideration."

Depending on the site of the defect the distal extent of the vascular pedicle may be in virtual continuity with it; if it is not, the forearm incision is extended to bring it into continuity with the defect.
